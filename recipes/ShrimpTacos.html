        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Spicy Sriracha Shrimp Tacos are fast, flavorful, and topped with a zesty Cilantro Lime Slaw that will rock yours socks! Recipe yields 4-6 tacos.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>6-12 soft corn tortillas see notes</li>
        <li>1 pound shrimp fresh or frozen/thawed</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic powder </li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 TBSP avocado oil (or favorite healthy oil)</li>
        <li>¼ cup homemade or store-bought ranch dressing*</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Sriracha</li>
        <li>1 cup finely shredded/chopped cabbage** (green, red, or both!)</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño pepper</li>
        <li>1-2 TBSP apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 TBSP honey</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp salt</li>
        <li>fresh chopped cilantro to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Clean and peel shrimp, defrosting if needed. Lately we’ve been buying frozen, deveined, easy-peel shrimp. All I have to do is defrost, peel, and cook! You can also buy your shrimp already peeled if you’d like!</li>
        <li>Set prepped shrimp in the fridge, covered while you make your slaw and sauce.</li>
        <li>For the Sriracha Ranch, simply whisk together both ingredients. For a spicier sauce, add extra Sriracha to taste.</li>
        <li>For the Cilantro Lime Slaw, remove the stem/seeds/ribs from the jalapeño, cut into strips and mince. Combine with cabbage, apple cider vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. Cut your lime in half and add juice of half the lime into your slaw. Toss together and add as much cilantro as your heart desires! Slice the remaining half into wedges for your tacos. Adjust honey to taste and set aside to marinate while you cook the shrimp.</li>
        <li>Pat shrimp dry and season with paprika, cayenne, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan or skillet to medium-high heat with 1 TBSP of oil and sauté your shrimp. Cook on each side for about 2 minutes until shrimp curl and become opaque. The cook time will depend on the heat setting you choose and the size of your shrimp, but regardless they’ll be perfectly cooked in a matter of minutes.</li>
        <li>Place your shrimp on a clean cutting board and chop into smaller pieces, much like you were coarsely chopping an onion. This extra step helps prevent the shrimp from dive-bombing out of your taco and onto your plate/lap/floor and makes them way easier to eat!</li>
        <li>Line your corn tortillas with shrimp and top with a hearty drizzle of sauce. Double up on corn tortillas if desired to prevent breakage (see notes) – I like to gently warm my corn tortillas up in the microwave or on a skillet before stuffing them. So good!</li>
        <li>Top with slaw, serve with lime wedges, and dig in!</li>
