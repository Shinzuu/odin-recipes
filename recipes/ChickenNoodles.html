        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One pot and 15 minutes are all you need to make this delicious dish!
            As an added bonus, each serving of this healthy + delicious chicken zoodle soup clocks in under 300 calories. Jackpot!</p>
        <p>Can I gush about how amazing this is for a moment? It’s SO GOOD and just earned itself a spot on next week’s meal plan. Probably the week after to. And the one after that… 
            Zucchini noodles for president!    
            Seriously though – it made SUCH a great lunch! Quick, easy, and, remember how I was complaining about dishes? Well I was being tres dramatic, because this soup was made entirely in one pot! Good thing too, because there’s still totally dishes sitting in the sink from breakfast.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 oz chicken breast (approx. 1 large)</li>
            <li>4 cups broth (chicken or vegetable)</li>
            <li>¼ tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 large zucchini squash</li>
            <li>½ TBSP fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp fresh chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp Sriracha plus extra to taste</li>
            <li>2 slices/wedges of lime</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your chicken into slices and add to a pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add broth, garlic powder [or fresh garlic!] and cumin and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked thoroughly, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks, use a spiralizer to transform your zucchini into tasty noodles.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is ready, add zucchini noodles and lime juice to the soup and simmer for an additional 3 minutes until desired tenderness is reached. For softer noodles, feel free to cook them a tad longer.</li>
            <li>Transfer soup to two large bowls and top each with fresh cilantro and a hearty drizzle of Sriracha chili sauce. Add a little, or a lot! I go nuts with mine, the garlic chili sauce flavor is fantastic with the tender chicken and savory broth. Serve with lime wedges for a burst of citrus flavor.</li>
            <li>Dive in while it’s hot!</li>

        </ol>
